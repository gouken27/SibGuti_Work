        Why build an industry around a scale that cuts across established verticals? This question occurred to me on a long flight to Paris, to attend the opening ceremony of the 2025 International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQ), at UNESCO headquarters last month. I was part of an IEEE delegation led by 2025 IEEE President Kathleen Kramer. The event celebrated the 100th anniversary of several seminal quantum-science publications, including Wolfgang Pauli’s paper on his exclusion principle; Werner Heisenberg’s “Quantum-theoretical Re-interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations,” the first mathematically consistent formulation of quantum mechanics; and Max Born’s and Pascual Jordan’s treatise on matrix mechanics in “On Quantum Mechanics.”

That Paris event made me realize that quantum engineering has evolved very differently from, say, nanotechnology. In the early 2000s, governments around the world launched initiatives to nurture the nascent field of nanotechnology. Fast-forward two decades and nanotechnology has essentially been absorbed into verticals like semiconductors, advanced materials, and drug delivery. Like Bill Joy’s infamous gray goo, a silo-busting “nanotechnology industry” never materialized.

The quantum regime, however, is already its own thriving industry, perhaps because the science of it is so unique. Quantum engineering involves math and phenomena that are fundamentally different from the classical physics engineers have so successfully exploited up to now. And many quantum technologies are aimed at doing things that otherwise couldn’t be done at all. For instance, quantum cryptography is a completely different way of encrypting messages that uses quantum entanglement, which has no classical analogue.
