        Much of the world’s Web traffic is routed through data centers, which also fuel power-guzzling artificial intelligence (AI) applications. In the United States data centers consumed around 4 percent of the country’s total electricity in 2023, and that number is projected to rise up to 12 percent by 2028.

Some researchers are thinking big, formulating innovative schemes to make data centers more sustainable. Others, like Martin Karsten, a professor of systems and networking at the University of Waterloo, in Canada, are enhancing current methods in the tiniest of ways to reduce data-center energy consumption.

Karsten and his former master’s student, Peter Cai, uncovered inefficiencies in how the Linux operating system (OS) processes network traffic at the kernel level: The Linux kernel is the “seed” or core of the OS, managing communication and resources such as memory between the hardware and processes.

In the case of data centers, these processes entail figuring out where to send segments of information, called “data packets,” that are transmitted over the network. When the network receives a new packet, it triggers an interrupt request. The kernel sends this request to the CPU, which then puts its current task on hold to process the packet.
