    <h1>Engineers Are Using AI to Code Based on Vibes</h1>

        “Wait! Am I a vibe coder?”

That was my reaction to Andrej Karpathy’s viral post describing his new “vibe coding” workflow. On 2 February, Karpathy—a computer scientist and founding member of OpenAI—defined it as a style of programming where software engineers “give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.”

I understood what he meant, because I’d already practiced it. In the fall of 2024, I decided to see for myself what large language models could do and used them to revamp my personal website. I’ve since used AI to code several personal projects, including a graphical user interface (GUI) for AI speech-to-text transcription on my Windows laptop and a JavaScript app for tracking initiative in tabletop games.

Though I’ve played with HTML and Python in the distant past, my knowledge of programming is limited, and I can’t explain in detail how the AI-generated code in these programs functions. But they work, and the ease with which I created them has implications for software engineering.
