        Modern society is becoming increasingly data hungry, especially as the use of AI continues to grow exponentially. As a result, ensuring enough memory—and power to sustainably support that memory—has become a major concern.

Now, the software company Kove has figured out a way to pool and dynamically allocate server memory in a way that dramatically boosts memory efficiency. Kove’s system leverages external pooled memory to produce results even faster than can be achieved with local memory.

For one of Kove’s clients, the approach reduced the power consumption of servers by up to 54 percent. For another, it slashed the time needed to run a complex AI model by a factor of 60.

John Overton, the CEO of Kove, has been working on this software solution for 15 years. He emphasizes that meeting the high demand for memory is one of the most pressing concerns facing the computer industry. “You hear of people running out of memory all the time,” he says, noting the AI and machine learning algorithms require huge amounts of data.
