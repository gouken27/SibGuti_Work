        Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Summit, its annual conference held in Maui, Hawaii, took the wraps off the new generation of processors for PCs, Snapdragon X2.

First introduced last year as part of Microsoft’s high-profile Copilot AI PC push, the processor lineup was notable because its CPU cores use the Arm instruction set instead of x86. That initial Snapdragon X rollout was targeted at smaller and more portable Windows PCs. But for its next move, Qualcomm is looking to expand its reach with a third-generation CPU and an upgraded neural processing unit (NPU), a one-two punch meant to accelerate AI workloads in mini PCs, all-in-one desktops, and high-performance laptops.

“We’re going to bring AI everywhere,” says Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon. “Everything we’ve been talking about is starting to happen, and this dream of what’s going to happen with AI, it’s getting to the point where we see what’s going to happen at scale.”
